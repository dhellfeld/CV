## Curriculum Vitae and Resume

#### To compile
Both docuements can be compiled using `make`. Use `make help` for additional options. Logs and other build files will be placed in the `logs/` directory and PDFs will be placed in the `pdfs/` directory. Current build engine is `pdflatex`.

#### Credit
Credit to Michael DeCorte for the `res.cls` file that I have modified slightly over time.
